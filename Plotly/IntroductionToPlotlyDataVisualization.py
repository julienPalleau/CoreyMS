1. How to create any chart you want using plotly documentation: 3 steps that I use for creating powerful graphs & charts with Plotly:
    a. Initiate your graph with Plotly sample code, and adapt it to your data
        (https://plotly.com/python)
    b. Enhance your graph with Plotly Express High-level interface
        (https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/plotly.express.html)
    c. Customize your graphs with Plotly Graph_Objects, using fig.Updates
        (https://plotly.com/python/reference/index/)
            i. Layout represents the chart (frames, title, color, tick, hover, legend)
            ii. Traces are representing the data (inside the layout)

    d.
            i. update_traces
            ii. update_layout
            iii. update_annotations
            iv. update_yaxes
            v. update_xaxes
