Object Oriented Programming Introduction

+ Object Oriented Programming (OOP) alllows programmers to create their own objects have methods and attributes.
+ Recall that after defining a string, list, dictionary, or other objects, you were able to call methods off of them
  with the .method_name() syntax.

These methods act as functions that use iformation about the object, as well as the object itself to return results, or
change the current object.

For example this includes appending to a list, or counting the occurences of an element in a tuple.

OOP allows users to create their own objects.
The general format is often confusing when first encountered, and its usfulness may not be completely clear at first.

In general, OOP allows us to create code that is repeatable and organized.

For much larger scripts of Python code, functions by temselves aren't enough for organization and repeatability.

Commonly repeated tasks and objects can be defined with OOP to create code that is more usable.
